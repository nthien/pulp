Pulp uses a vanilla version of mongoengine 0.9.0, except for one
patch which removes Pillow as a setuptools dependency. Not
having Pillow installed at runtime will disable the ImageField,
but mongoengine will operate fully otherwise. At the time I built
mongoengine 0.9.0, Pillow is not available on EL6.

python-mongoengine requires at least pymongo 2.7.1 at runtime.

The spec file was originally adapted from the spec file inside of
python-mongoengine-0.8.4-3.el7.src.rpm [0].
