Celery 3.1.11 requires kombu>=3.0.15,<4.0, which is not in Fedora <= 20,
or EPEL <= 7.

Pulp would like to use the Qpid transport which is available in upstream
kombu>=3.0.24


Permanent Patches:

1212200.patch - This patch will need to continue to be with us forever as
                it works around a permanent downstream issue whereby
                ordereddict is installed as part of the Python system
                library, and not in site-packages. This is not
                contributed to upstream Kombu.
