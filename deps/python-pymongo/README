Pulp currently uses a vanilla version of pymongo 2.7.2. That is
the latest Z release for the pymongo 2.7 release stream.

python-mongoengine requires at least pymongo 2.7.1 at runtime.

The spec file was originally adapted from the spec file inside of
python-pymongo-2.5.2-7.fc23.src.rpm [0]. Thanks also to dgoodwin
and Dominic in #tito for the spec file help.
