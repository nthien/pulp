# authorities. If it is false, client certificates will not be checked for signature or expiration.
# If you don't need per-repo CAs, it is recommended to set this to false and use your web server to
# check the client certificates against a trusted CA back. Setting this to true will have a negative
# performance impact, so don't do that unless you need per-repo CAs. It is true by default to
