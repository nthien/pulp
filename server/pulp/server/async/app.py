    This function performs all the necessary initialization of the Celery worker.

    It starts by cleaning up old state if this worker was previously running, but died unexpectedly.
    In such cases, any Pulp tasks that were running or waiting on this worker will show incorrect
    state. Any reserved_resource reservations associated with the previous worker will also be
    removed along with the worker entry in the database itself. The working directory specified in
    /etc/pulp/server.conf (/var/cache/pulp/<worker_name>) by default is removed and recreated. This
    is called early in the worker start process, and later when it's fully online, pulp_celerybeat
    will discover the worker as usual to allow new work to arrive at this worker. If there is no
    previous work to cleanup, this method still runs, but has no effect on the database.

    After cleaning up old state, it ensures the existence of the worker's working directory.

    Lastly, this function makes the call to Pulp's initialization code.

    It uses the celeryd_after_setup signal[0] so that it gets called by Celery after logging is
    initialized, but before Celery starts to run tasks.
