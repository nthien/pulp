Welcome to the Pulp dev environment!

Here are some tips:
* Your code is all checked out inside of ~/devel/.
* The default username:password is admin:admin. When your session expires, you
  can log in again with pulp-admin login -u admin
* You can type workon <project> to quickly cd to a project dir and activate its
  virtualenv. For example:

    $ workon pulp_python

  Similarly, run "workon pulp" to jump into the pulp platform virtualenv.
* Each project has a "run-tests.py" to run the unit tests.
* There are a set of bash functions in your .bashrc that are useful: pstart,
  pstop, prestart, pstatus, and ptests. They will start, stop, restart, tell you
  the status of all of the Pulp services, and run all unit tests.
* You can ssh into your vagrant environment with vagrant ssh, but presumably
  you already know this since you are reading this message :)

More information can be found at
https://pulp.readthedocs.org/en/latest/dev-guide/ and you can ask questions in
#pulp on Freenode IRC.

Happy hacking, and thanks for your contribution!
